# Google Prep Course (python version)

## 1.) watch these 2 videos
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qc1owf2-220&feature=youtu.be
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWbUtlUhwa8&feature=youtu.be

## 2.) Review your past jobs and side projects
* Think of all the things you did that were instering, then think of the most  most interesting solutions you came up to sovle the issue at hand
* google says this: 
Your background is important, so utilize it to your advantage by sharing interesting points that can help you and the engineer work through the discussion as efficient as possi

__## Computer Science fundementals__

## 3.) Algorithum Complexity 
* big-o notaion (must know or you will fail)
big-o-notation =  A theoretical measure of the execution of an algorithm, usually the time or memory needed, given the problem size n, which is usually the number of items. Informally, saying some equation f(n) = O(g(n)) means it is less than some constant multiple of g(n).

F(n)      Name
1         Constant
log n     Logarithmic
n         Linear
n log n   Log Linear
n^2       Quadratic
n^3       Cubic
2^n       Exponential

## 4.) Coding (pick you language, C++ idealy im going to pick python)

###read the following
* Programming Interviews Exposed; Secrets to landing your next job by John Monagan and Noah Suojanen (Wiley Computer Publishing)
http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-047012167X.html

## 5. systems
* system design:  http://research.google.com/pubs/DistributedSystemsandParallelComputing.html
* google file system: http://research.google.com/archive/gfs.html

* google bigtable:  http://research.google.com/archive/bigtable.html

* Google MapReduce: http://research.google.com/archive/mapreduce.html

## 6. Sorting
* know how to sort, bubble-sort least important but know it
* Know all the ni\*log(n) sorting algorithm
* know these for sure:quicksort and merge sort
* know why Merge sort can be highly useful in situations 
* know where quicksort is impractical.

## 7. hashtables (must know or will fail)
* Be able to implement one using only arrays in your favorite language, in about the space of one interview.

## 8. Trees
*  basic tree construction, traversal and manipulation algorithms.
* Familiarize yourself with binary trees, n-ary trees, and trie-trees
* Be familiar with at least one type of balanced binary tree, whether it's a red/black tree, a splay tree or an AVL tree, and know how it's implemented
* Understand tree traversal algorithms: BFS and DFS, and know the difference between inorder, postorder and preorder.

## 9. Graphs
* 3 basic ways to represent a graph in memory (objects and pointers, matrix, and adjacency list); familiarize yourself with each representation and its pros & cons
* You should know the basic graph traversal algorithms: breadth-first search and depth-first search
* Know their computational complexity, their tradeoffs, and how to implement them in real code
* study up on fancier algorithms, such as Dijkstra and A\*.

## 10. Other data structures
* know about the most famous classes of NP-complete problems, such as traveling salesman and the knapsack problem, and be able to recognize them when an interviewer asks you them in disguise.
* Find out what NP-complete means

## 11 Mathmatics
* Spend some time before the interview refreshing your memory on (or teaching yourself) the essentials of combinatorics and probability. You should be familiar with n-choose-k problems and their ilk – the more the better.

## 12 Operating Syatems
* Know about processes, threads and concurrency issues
* Know about locks and mutexes and semaphores and monitors and how they work
* Know about deadlock and livelock and how to avoid them
* Know what resources a processes needs, and a thread needs, and how context switching works, and how it's initiated by the operating system and underlying hardware
* Know a little about scheduling. 
* The world is rapidly moving towards multi-core, so know the fundamentals of "modern" concurrency constructs.
